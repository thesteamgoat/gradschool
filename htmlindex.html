	<p><strong>S. Michele Holmes is currently working towards her Teaching and Learning Technologies Master's Degree from The University of North Texas's Computer Education and Cognitive Systems Program. Michele received her Bachelor's Degree in Psychology and Business Administration from The University of North Alabama in 1999 but attended Mississippi State University for several years. She spent the early years of her career in education as an intermediate school ESL teacher. After a short stint as a 7th grade math teacher where she discovered her passion for new technologies, she spent three years honing her instructional technology and design skills as a 5th grade science and gifted program teacher. She now supports her students and faculty coordinating the campus ESL program and coaching her campus robotics team. Her primary research areas are educational gaming, classroom gamificiation, digital portfolios, mobile devices including BYOD, and social media in the classroom. She enjoys her classes, blogging, music, and taking care of her husband and two children. After completing her Master's Degree, Michele hopes to become an Instructional Technologist for a school district. Because she views technology as a means to differentiate instruction to assist all learners in reaching their full potential, she desires to consult with teachers and staff on how to incorporate more technology in their classrooms and professional development. In her spare time, she also wants to design and develop educational video games.</strong></p>
